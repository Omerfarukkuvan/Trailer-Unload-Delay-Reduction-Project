# Trailer-Unload-Delay-Reduction-Project
Analysis and optimization of trailer unloading delays to improve warehouse efficiency and reduce dwell times.

## 📦 Project Purpose
The main objective of this project was to investigate and minimize trailer unloading delays at warehouses. These delays caused operational challenges, including decreased customer satisfaction, inventory discrepancies, financial losses, and increased yard congestion.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The primary causes of the delays were identified under two main areas:

1. *Warehouse Response Delays:*  
   Delayed responses from warehouse teams hindered coordination with the inbound operations team, prolonging the process.

2. *Warehouse Resolution Delays:*  
   Some warehouses exhibited significantly higher average resolution times, indicating inefficiencies in issue handling.

---

## 📊 Analysis Overview
- *Observation Period:* 45–50 days  
- *Key Metrics Tracked:* Response times, resolution times, trailer dwell times  
- *Data Analysis:* Detailed data analysis was conducted to identify root causes of delays.

---

## ⚙️ Features / Improvements Implemented
- Weekly dashboards to monitor warehouse response and resolution times  
- Standardized escalation protocols to reduce dwell times  
- Targeted communication and collaboration with underperforming warehouses  
- Identification and prioritization of high-impact trailers for faster unloading

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- *Excel:* Pivot tables, conditional formatting, formulas for data tracking  
- *Power BI:* Dashboard visualizations for trends and KPI tracking  
- *Internal Systems:* YMS (Yard Management System), EDI data for trailer status monitoring

---

## 📂 Data Sources
- Warehouse response and resolution logs  
- Trailer delivery and unload status from YMS  
- Inbound operations team reports  
- Historical performance data for benchmarking

---

## 🎯 Measurable Results / Outcome
- Reduced average trailer dwell time by *18%* over the observation period  
- Improved on-time trailer unload rate from *72% to 89%*  
- Strengthened collaboration between warehouse and transportation teams  
- Enhanced operational efficiency and proactive issue resolution

---

## 📌 Notes
This project demonstrates strong *data analysis, process improvement, and cross-functional collaboration* skills, and can serve as a reference for similar logistics and operations optimization initiatives.
