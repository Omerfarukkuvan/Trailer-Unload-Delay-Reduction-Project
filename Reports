## 🧩 Project Conclusion

Over a 45–50 day observation period, trailer unloading operations were closely monitored across selected warehouses.  
The main objective was to accelerate the business process, minimize potential losses, and improve overall warehouse responsiveness.

It was identified that *delayed responses from warehouse operations teams* were directly contributing to prolonged issue resolution times. These delays prevented timely actions and led to extended trailer dwell durations.

To address these inefficiencies:

- Warehouses with *above-average response and resolution times* were identified and summarized in a tracking table.  
- The findings were communicated with *warehouse leadership teams, focusing on reducing response and resolution delays through **cross-functional collaboration* between inbound and warehouse operations.  
- For warehouses with *consistently long unloading and resolution durations*, root causes were analyzed in detail, and corrective actions were implemented to eliminate repetitive issues.

This initiative aims to apply *proactive and data-driven solutions* to minimize trailer unload times, enhance warehouse efficiency, and strengthen overall operational performance across the network.
