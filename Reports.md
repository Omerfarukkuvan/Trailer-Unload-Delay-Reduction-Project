## 🧩 Project Conclusion

Over a 45–50 day observation period, trailer unloading operations were closely monitored across selected warehouses.  
The main objective was to accelerate the business process, minimize potential losses, and improve overall warehouse responsiveness.

It was identified that *delayed responses from warehouse operations teams* were directly contributing to prolonged issue resolution times. These delays prevented timely actions and led to extended trailer dwell durations.

To address these inefficiencies:

- Warehouses with *above-average response and resolution times* were identified and summarized in a tracking table.  
- The findings were communicated with *warehouse leadership teams, focusing on reducing response and resolution delays through **cross-functional collaboration* between inbound and warehouse operations.  
- For warehouses with *consistently long unloading and resolution durations*, root causes were analyzed in detail, and corrective actions were implemented to eliminate repetitive issues.

This initiative aims to apply *proactive and data-driven solutions* to minimize trailer unload times, enhance warehouse efficiency, and strengthen overall operational performance across the network.

# 📊 KPI Summary – Warehouse Resolution by Root Cause

## 🧭 Overall Insights
- Average resolution times range between **1–8 days**, with some outliers up to **14–17 days**.  
- Most common categories: **Carrier Delayed Delivery**, **In Transit**, **Freight Reject**, and **Warehouse Missed Appointment**.  
- A few warehouses show exceptional delays tied to **handling** and **safety** issues.

## ⚠️ Root Causes with the Longest Resolution Time

| Root Cause | Avg. Resolution Time (days) | Observation |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| **No handling** | 14 (C7JR), 17 (Y7ZG) | Longest delays; unclear ownership or missing process definition. |
| **Safety Issue** | 11 (Q8ZU, W4AQ) | Safety-related events take significantly longer to resolve. |
| **Freight Reject** | ~7 (E5FN) | Rejected freight requires rebooking and coordination, causing extra delay. |
| **Reject - Safety** | 6–8 | Safety-related rejects require additional verification steps. |

## ⚡ Root Causes with the Shortest Resolution Time

| Root Cause | Avg. Resolution Time (days) | Observation |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| **Carrier Issue** | 1–3 | Fast resolution via carrier communication. |
| **FC Missed ISA** | 1–2 | Typically system-level fixes resolved promptly. |
| **Same Appointment** | 1–2 | Minimal operational impact; quick scheduling adjustments. |

## 🏭 Warehouse Highlights

| Warehouse | Key Notes |
|------------|------------|
| **C7JR** | “No handling” – 14 days (high delay) |
| **Y7ZG** | “No handling” – 17 days (highest delay overall) |
| **Q8ZU & W4AQ** | “Safety Issue” – 11 days (safety workflow bottlenecks) |
| **A1FF & P3MF** | Strong performers with average resolution under 4 days |

_Analysis based on “Average of Resolution Time (days)” KPI chart across multiple warehouses._


![Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/Omerfarukkuvan/Trailer-Unload-Delay-Reduction-Project/blob/main/Data/Warehouse%20Resolution%20by%20Cause.png)

For example, at the C7JR warehouse, the average unload time is 14 days due to the "No Handling" root cause, which is considered an excessively long duration for the company.  

For this warehouse, products that cannot be handled should no longer be directed there. This approach will:  
- Eliminate the extra workload caused by redirects,  
- Ensure these specific products enter inventory faster,  
- Reduce yard congestion at the warehouse.  

In this way, root causes are analyzed for each warehouse individually, with the objective of minimizing unload times and optimizing overall operational efficiency.

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Investigate “No handling” and “Safety Issue” categories**  
   → Conduct detailed RCA (Root Cause Analysis) to identify bottlenecks.
2. **Implement alert or monitoring systems** for *Freight Reject* cases.  
3. **Benchmark high-performing warehouses** like *A1FF* and *P3MF* for best practices.  
4. **Track trends over time** (monthly/quarterly) to detect recurring issues.  
5. **Set auto-escalation rules** for cases older than 7 days.
